## Features
Currently, the mod showcases several features:

* Discord RPC - Show the world what you're up to at TubNet!
* TubNet Panorama - Replaces the default title screen panorama with a TubNet-themed version!
* Better Resource Reloading Screen - Force the resource reload screen to show the TubNet logo and a TubNet brand color.
* Compact Chat - Stops repeated messages from clogging up your chat
* [TubNet Tweaks](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/tubnet-tweaks) loader - Automatically download and load TubNet Tweaks into the game!
* ...and more! There be loads of frequent updates in the coming weeks, so stay tuned!


## Installing
This mod is only available for Minecraft: Java Edition. If you're on Bedrock Edition, and own Bedrock for Windows, it might be a good idea to [use Java Edition instead](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4607523809933-Buy-Minecraft-PC-Bundle-Get-Both-Games-).
